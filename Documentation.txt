//CLIENT
ClientWindow is the top-most JFrame.
Everything window-related goes here(setting full screen, etc)

There is a ClientPanels panel inside the window.
This has all other panels as instances, and shifts between each one.
(See the demo for assignment 3 for specifics)

StartScreen is the first screen.
Its functionality is only to let the user go to MainMenu.

MainMenu is the main menu where users can choose between friendly and competitive games.

//LIBRARY
ProjectFonts stores the fonts used in the project.
Call ProjectFonts.set..Font(Component) to set font.

ImageLibrary renders image urls.
